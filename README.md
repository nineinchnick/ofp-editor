# OpenFloorPlan Editor

Update (Jan. 2015): This project will need a lot of work before it is usable. It is not completely dead, I do plan to get back to it in some form. If you interested in contributing feel free to send me a message.

## Basics

* OpenFloorPlan Editor is a JavaScript editor for creating SVG floorplans.
* This is a fork of the awesome iD editor for [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) https://github.com/systemed/iD

This is pre-alpha code, intended as a proof of concept, more information will follow.



## Installation

To run the current development version, fork this project, run `make`, and serve it locally.
If you have Python handy, just `cd` into the project root directory and run

     python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Or, with a Mac, you can enable Web Sharing and clone iD into your website directory.
